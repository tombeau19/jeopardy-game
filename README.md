# jeopardy-game

#Project Description --
    We were tasked with creating a functional game from a predetermined set of options. I elected to create a Jeopardy game. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery I was able to style a board and create user interaction. Using modals and multiple choice I was able to ask for users to answer questions specific to a point total and category. The user has the ability to input their name in a bottom left username input box. In the bottom right the score board accurately adds and subtracts points based on user success.
    
    The largest obstacle I faced was creating a final Jeopardy. I wanted to first give the user a category so they could bid off their comfort level. I had to nest a modal-trigger inside a already deployed modal. The final scored accurately subtracs/adds the user wager and is displayed on the bottom right. There are checks and balances to make sure the use does not wager more than they have, and it ends the game if the user is in the negatives. Also, if the user enters a string instead of the number they will be prompted to fix that error.
